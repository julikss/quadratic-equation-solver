# Quadratic-Equation-Solver
You can use this tool to solve the quadratic equations by using terminal.


## Setup

1. Install Node JS

2. Clone the repository with the following command:
```bash
https://github.com/julikss/quadratic-equation-solver.git
```

3. Open the project folder and run command:
```bash
node main.js
```


## Usage
There are two modes - interactive and non-interactive(file mode). To choose a certain mode, 
user needs to enter a specific digit ("0" for interactive and "1" for non-interactive). 

In interactive mode, user works with the terminal by entering coefficients of an equation.

In non-interactive mode, user needs to write the cofficients in txt file in format 'a b c'
and then enter the file name to the terminal to launch the program.
